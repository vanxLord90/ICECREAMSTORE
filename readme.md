This is a project that showcases my Model-View-Controller skills using Java Spring Boot and Vue.js
To run it: 

clone the project 

mvn clean install

run IceCreamStoreApplication.java

cd into frontend

run npm run dev

go to localhost:3000 and the webapp will be shown there.

For further improvements I am working on integrating database, and rest-api.
